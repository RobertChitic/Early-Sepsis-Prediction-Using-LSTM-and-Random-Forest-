CONFUSION MATRICES
================================================================================

LSTM:
  True Negatives:  19,863  |  False Positives: 96
  False Negatives: 67   |  True Positives:  422

Random Forest:
  True Negatives:  19,454  |  False Positives: 505
  False Negatives: 215   |  True Positives:  274

================================================================================
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
================================================================================

False Negatives (Missed Sepsis Cases):
  LSTM:           67 cases (13.7% of sepsis)
  Random Forest:  215 cases (44.0% of sepsis)
  LSTM catches:   148 MORE sepsis cases

False Positives (Unnecessary Alarms):
  LSTM:           96 false alarms
  Random Forest:  505 false alarms

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. LSTM significantly outperforms Random Forest on sepsis detection
   - 54.0% higher recall means fewer missed cases
   - Critical in healthcare where false negatives can be fatal

2. AUPRC shows massive advantage (132.0% improvement)
   - More informative metric for imbalanced medical data
   - Demonstrates LSTM's superior handling of rare events

3. LSTM captures temporal patterns that Random Forest cannot
   - Sequential learning detects patient deterioration trends
   - Random Forest treats each hour independently

4. Trade-offs:
   - LSTM: Better performance but "black box" (low interpretability)
   - Random Forest: Lower performance but explainable (clinical trust)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

For clinical deployment: LSTM is recommended due to:
  - Superior sepsis detection (86.3% vs 56.0% recall)
  - Better handling of class imbalance (AUPRC: 0.87 vs 0.37)
  - Ability to capture temporal deterioration patterns

However, consider hybrid approach:
  - Use LSTM for prediction
  - Use Random Forest feature importance for clinical interpretation
  - Combine both for decision support with explanation
